# Learning C Programming

This repository contains my C programming practice projects as I learn software development.

## Projects

### Age Calculator
A simple C program that:
- Takes user input for birth year
- Calculates current age based on 2024
- Displays the result

My first C program written from scratch!

### Simple Calculator
A basic calculator program that:
- Accepts two numbers from the user
- Performs basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /)
- Returns the calculated result
- Uses conditional statements to handle different operations

### First-Year Study Organizer
A console project designed for a first-year software engineering student. It helps to:
- Add courses with credit values and grades
- View a neatly formatted course list
- Estimate a GPA based on entered data
- Read motivational study tips to stay on track

## Skills Demonstrated
- User input/output with scanf and printf
- Working with strings and structures
- Variable declaration and assignment
- Conditional logic (if statements and switch statements)
- Basic arithmetic operations and simple algorithms
- Character and integer data types

## About
First-year Software Engineering student building foundational programming skills in C. Each project represents hands-on learning and problem-solving practice.

## Next Steps
- Exploring more complex C programs
- Building projects that solve real-world problems
- Expanding into other programming languages
